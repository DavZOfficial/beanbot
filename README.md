# beanbot
posts random picture of beans in weird places if you say bean in discord.


To add this bot to your server, you got to both make a bot in discord and make a bot in reddit. 

Make a .env file and put your corresponding information like this:

        REDDIT_CLIENT=<>
        REDDIT_SECRET=<>
        REDDIT_PASSWORD=<>
        DISCORD_ID=<>
        DISCORD_TOKEN=<>

Replace information as needed.

Dependencies: discord.py, os, random, praw, python-dotenv
